  storyText: "To be branded a traitor by the Queen is a serious charge. And you have
    often witnessed such 'disposition of punishments' before.  You realize something
    must have gone very wrong back at Court, and your chances of even being allowed
    to plead your case are slim, if at possible at all. You decide the best course,
    would be to gather intelligence, and determine the reason behind the Queens decree.
    But where to begin?  Should you attempt to sneak into Flynn's Landing under a
    different guise, or perhaps set course for Eribor Harbor, and speak with your
    sometime's friend, often enemy Jarot. He has an ear to most happenings withing
    the Kingdom. \n\n1. Sneak into Flynn's Landing.\n2. Chance a meeting with Jarot
    in Eribor Harbor."
