  storyText: "With a the wind in your hair, and the gentle slapping of your trench
    coat against your body, you look down upon the vista a thousand feet below you.
    \r\nYou are Captain of the Royal Airship 'Heracles'. In your hand you have a
    decree from the Queen, recently delivered via carrier pigeon. \r\nIt states,
    in simplest of terms, that you have been branded a traitor to the Crown, and
    you are ordered to return to Flynn's Landing for dispensation of punishment.\r\nYou
    are unaware of what pretense you have been branded as such, and a decision must
    be made.\"\n\r\n1. Return to Flynn's Landing, in an attempt to clear your name.\r\n2.
    Delay returning Flynn's Landing, and attempt to clear your name first."
